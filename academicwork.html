									<p>Bendele, R (2019). <a href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5805/">Negotiating Masculinity in Tabletop Roleplaying Game Spaces</a> (Unpublished master's Thesis). Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United States. </p>
                                    <p style="margin-left: 40px">As video games and other gaming has become a popular media form, with 60% of Americans playing games daily (Entertainment Software Association [ESA], 2018), gaming communities have increased in size and participation. While scholarly research has consistently found that women are marginalized in these communities, little research has looked at how men see these communities. Research on homosociality shows that men use communities and relationships with other men to access masculinity (Bird, 1996; Dellinger, 2004; Houston, 2012). Building on game studies and masculinity studies, this research looks at the way men in tabletop roleplaying game communities understand their involvement and the ways their involvement connects with masculinity. Tabletop gaming communities give men access to a form of masculinity they may be denied, primarily by providing access to other ways of building social capital and relationships with other men.</p>
